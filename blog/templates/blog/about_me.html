		      <h1 class="display-4">Life and Career</h1>
		      <p class="lead">
		      	I started my career as a Junior Instrument Engineer in a Paper manufacturing plant in Raipur, Chattisgarh. It was the middle of the job crisis black period year 2008 and I had no option but to make the best of what I got. I think I did well during my 11 month stay . I actually loved the hot chemical aroma filled environment of a paper machine.
		      </p>

		      	I got my first break into the IT world and eventually an IT city in 2009 . This time the credit solely goes to my mother . I had already given up all hopes when my mother dragged
		      	me to a job fair where for 3 days, more than 15000 people attended it. But I was the only one to make it inside EA Mobiles. No stopping now. For two and a half year, I laboured day and night .

		      	I got to practise the programmer inside me as a professional in 2012. I joined <strong>bigbasket.com</strong> in Bangalore. The team was small. The office smaller. Yet I loved it.
		      	Met a lot of geeks, inspiration was overflowing. I sharpened my Python and Computer Science skills and eventually arrived at Pune, Maharashtra.

		      	I had spend enough time in South India and it was time now to switch to the north . And it was well worth it . I got to take a break from the struggle that kept me awake from
		      	6 years . I discovered , trekking, travelling , music, life .
